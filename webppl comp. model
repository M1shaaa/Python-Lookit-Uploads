### basically, I lost dozens and dozens of lines of code in my mentor's notion page, but here's a sample of the work I was doing this summer
### (building the computational model on webppl/JS)

'''

Infer({method: 'enumerate'}, function() {
    var Desire = flip()
    var Norm = flip()
    var WeightedDesire = Desire * 2
    var WeightedNorm = Norm
    var Behavior = (Desire || Norm)
    return Behavior;
  })
